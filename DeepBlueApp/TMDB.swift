/*
    Swift has pseudo-namespacing by allowing you to embed certain
    objects within eachother. This provides us with the following
    syntax: `TMDB.Error.InvalidAPIKey`.

    You don't have to do this. There isn't anything wrong with
    simply calling it TMDBError and not nesting it.

    By making the backing type of the error an Int we can map
    it directly to error codes from the TMDB API:
    https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api/status-codes

    The extension here is just to break things up - you could
    keep it all in the main definition if you wanted to.
